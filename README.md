# Capstone
This is the Udacity Capstone Project!

All the following libraries are needed to implement this project:

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- PySpark
- Spark

I used the Anaconda distribution of Python which has most of the data science libraries preinstalled

# Project

This project was part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree to learn more about customer churn analysis. For this Udacity created a fictional data set called Sparkify. The dataset contains user behaviour log for the past few months. A user can have multiple actions which leads to multiple entries for a user, we can identify when a user churned through the action of account cancellation.

# Results

I trained three different models which you can find in the .ipynb notbook. A detailed description is here;
